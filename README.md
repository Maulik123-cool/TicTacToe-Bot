# TicTacToe-Bot
This Tic Tac Toe bot is a fun little game you can play right in your terminal. It lets two players take turns placing Xs and Os on a simple 3x3 grid, checking for winners or a draw after every move. Itâ€™s polite, fair, and even a bit sassy if you imagine it that way â€” it wonâ€™t let you cheat, and itâ€™ll remind you if you make an invalid move.
